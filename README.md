# Autism_Eye

## Project Description
This project develops an automated system for early autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis using eye tracking technology and Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods. The system analyzes visual attention patterns through three different AI approaches to identify atypical behaviors associated with autism.

## Key Features:

- Eye tracking data analysis for ASD detection
- Three AI methodologies for classification
- High accuracy rates (93.6% - 99.8%)
- Early diagnosis support tool

## Technologies Used:

- Neural Networks (NN)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- GoogleNet & ResNet-18 architectures
- Hybrid feature extraction (LBP + GLCM)

## Results:

Method 1 (NN + Hybrid Features): 99.8% accuracy
Method 2 (Pre-trained CNNs): 93.6% - 97.6% accuracy
Method 3 (CNN + SVM): 94.5% - 95.5% accuracy
