Eye tracking has emerged as a valuable technique for early autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) detection, capturing atypical visual attention patterns crucial for effective
learning. This study introduces three artificial intelligence methods for early
diagnosis: neural networks (NNs) using hybrid feature classification, pre-trained
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and hybrid deep learning/machine learning
(DL/ML) using CNNs and SVM. The first approach achieves a 99.8% accuracy with
feature classification from hybrid local binary pattern and grey level co-occurrence
matrix algorithms. The second method, employing Google Net and ResNet-18
models, attains 93.6% and 97.6% accuracies respectively through deep feature map
extraction. The third technique, combining Google Net/ResNet-18 with SVM,
showcases diagnostic prowess with accuracies of 95.5% and 94.5% respectively.
Overall, integrating eye tracking and AI methods proves effective for early ASD
diagnosis based on distinct visual behaviors.
